I'm very happy to publish today my Five Books interview with Hadley Wickham, one of the most respected programmers in the world of data science and R. Hadley recommended five of the best computer science books for data scientists, which gave us an opportunity to discuss programming languages, writing style, and the future of the tidyverse.

> Data science is often said to be built on three pillars: domain expertise, statistics, and programming. Hadley Wickham, Chief Scientist at RStudio and creator of many packages for the R programming language, chooses the best books to help aspiring data scientists build solid computer science fundamentals.

> Five Books is a comprehensive library of knowledge, curating book recommendations on any topic you might want to read about. We have covered 1,300 topics so far and add at least two new ones every week. We ask leaders in a field to make book recommendations in their area of expertise and explain their choices in an interview. Our interviews range from engaging introductions to specialist subjects—such as the Dutch Masters, Globalization, “Anti-memoirs”, Existentialism, Violence (or its decline)—to in-depth explorations of more personal themes and inspirations, from the likes of John Kerry, Ian McEwan, Margaret Drabble and Elif Shafak.

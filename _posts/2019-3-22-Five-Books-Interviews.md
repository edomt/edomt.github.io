title: My interviews for Five Books
---

Between 2018 and 2020, I had the pleasure of being part of the editorial team at [Five Books](https://www.fivebooks.com). I published several interviews on artificial intelligence, data, and programming, as well as a variety of other subjects:

* [Historical Change and Economic Ideology, with **Thomas Piketty**](https://fivebooks.com/best-books/economic-ideology-thomas-piketty/)
* [Computer Science for Data Scientists, with **Hadley Wickham**](https://fivebooks.com/best-books/computer-science-data-science-hadley-wickham/)
* [Effective Altruism, with **Will MacAskill**](https://fivebooks.com/best-books/effective-altruism-will-macaskill/)
* [Data Science, with **Roger D. Peng**](https://fivebooks.com/best-books/data-science-roger-peng/)
* [Existential Risks, with **The Centre for the Study of Existential Risk**](https://fivebooks.com/best-books/existential-risks-cambridge-cser/)
* [Learning Python and Data Science, with **Vicki Boykis**](https://fivebooks.com/best-books/learning-python-and-data-science-vicki-boykis/)
* [Computer Science and Programming, with **Ana Bell**](https://fivebooks.com/best-books/programming-computer-science-ana-bell/)
* [Modern Japanese Literature, with **Linda Flores**](https://fivebooks.com/best-books/modern-japanese-literature-linda-flores/)

_Five Books is a comprehensive library of knowledge, curating book recommendations on any topic you might want to read about. We ask leaders in a field to make book recommendations in their area of expertise and explain their choices in an interview. Our interviews range from engaging introductions to specialist subjects—such as the Dutch Masters, Globalization, “Anti-memoirs”, Existentialism, Violence (or its decline)—to in-depth explorations of more personal themes and inspirations, from the likes of John Kerry, Ian McEwan, Margaret Drabble and Elif Shafak._

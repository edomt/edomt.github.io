title: Reading the most important books on Effective Altruism 
---

I discovered the [Effective Altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/) community around 2015, and found it to be a deeply inspiring intellectual movement. In late 2018, I published [an interview of one of its key figures](https://fivebooks.com/best-books/effective-altruism-will-macaskill/), Will MacAskill, on the website Five Books. Since then, I have kept reading up on this subject, with the aim of reading at least 50 of the most important books on EA and related areas over the next few years. I'm currently using [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/shelf/show/effective-altruism) as my main source to identify books, but suggestions are always welcome!

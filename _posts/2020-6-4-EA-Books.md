I discovered the [effective altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/) community around 2015, and found it to be a very inspiring intellectual movement. As summarized [on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism), _"effective altruism is a philosophy and social movement that advocates using evidence and reasoning to determine the most effective ways to benefit others."_ Effective altruists focus their efforts, for example, on causes such as fighting extreme poverty, improving the long-term future, and reducing animal suffering. If you're interested in learning more, I recommend this great [introduction to effective altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/introduction-to-effective-altruism/).

## Donations

Since 2015, I have done my best to donate regularly to effective causes, such as the ones recommended by [GiveWell](https://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities). In 2018, I took the [Giving What We Can Pledge](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/pledge/), making a solemn commitment to giving at least 10% of my income to the organisations that can do the most good with it.

## Books

In late 2018, I published an interview with one of effective altruism's key figures, Will MacAskill, [on the website Five Books](https://fivebooks.com/best-books/effective-altruism-will-macaskill/). Since then, I have kept reading up on this subject, with the aim of reading at least 50 of the most important books on effective altruism and its related areas over the next few years (listed below). [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/shelf/show/effective-altruism) is currently my main source to identify books, but suggestions are always welcome!

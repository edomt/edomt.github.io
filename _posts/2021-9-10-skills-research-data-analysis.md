title: What are the necessary skills for research-oriented data analysis?
excerpt_separator: <!--more-->

The work that our team does at [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/about) (OWID) has become a lot more visible recently. It has led me to receive more frequent emails asking for advice on how to work with us, or grow their skills towards similar positions. In this post, I summarize the necessary skills to join our data team at OWID, or an "OWID-like" organization.

## Core skill

[Data wrangling](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-engineering-foundations) is the fundamental thing that our data team does at OWID. It is thus the most essential skill if you're considering joining us. You will need to be fluent in the use of pandas, or a similar package in R (dplyr, data.table). But our entire data pipeline uses Python, so we have a strong preference for analysts who use this language.

The fact that this is our core skill should not only make it clear what we do, but also what we _don't_ do. To solve most of the world’s largest problems, our team believes that machine learning isn't the most urgent next step. We work with datasets that are small by industry standards. And our tech stack is not at the cutting edge of data science and cloud services. Instead, we want to provide the world with the cleanest, most-reliable, best-documented datasets on the largest problems.

## Other necessary skills

It’s not only the technical skills for data wrangling that are essential. Research-oriented data analysis implies an ability to use data to understand the world, and to help others do the same. The "expert data wrangler" presented above would thus also need:

- Very good knowledge of [data visualization principles and good practices](https://www.goodreads.com/shelf/show/data-visualization);
- A good understanding of [our work at Our World in Data](https://ten7.com/podcast/episode/edouard-mathieu-open-data-approach-solving-worlds-problems) and [our mission](https://ourworldindata.org/problems-and-progress);
- Fluency in English;
- Strong experience with importing, transforming, and maintaining datasets for other users.

This last skill can seem difficult to showcase if you've recently graduated. But its presence here doesn't mean that you need to have worked for a large company before. For example, we love to hear from candidates who maintain ambitious open-source data projects on important subjects.

## Secondary skills

If the skills listed above make up the trunk of a tree, secondary skills are the branches. You don't need to grow all these branches to work well at OWID, but our data analysts tend to be proficient in at least one.

- Strong knowledge of [statistics](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/advanced-statistics-data-science);
- Strong knowledge of [programming](https://fivebooks.com/best-books/computer-science-data-science-hadley-wickham/);
- Strong knowledge of academic research, ability to understand publications, experience with science communication;
- Experience with the development, maintenance, and documentation of large public datasets.

## Metaskills

Beyond [the skills that are useful to perform well in any job](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/how-to-be-successful/), here are the ones that are the most important for what we do:

- Extreme attention to detail;
- Being able to assess what data is accurate and insightful and which is not;
- Recognizing shared behaviors and patterns that provide solutions to data problems;
- Intellectual curiosity, openness to new ideas;
- Interest in learning about novel research topics;
- Flexibility to receive feedback, learn from new evidence, and change one's mind;
- Ability and drive to work without supervision;
- Proactivity, assertiveness.

## Opportunities at OWID

Even though our team has grown a lot, we still rarely open new positions. When we do so, you'll be able to find them on [our _Jobs_ page](https://ourworldindata.org/jobs). You can also follow us on Twitter ([OWID](https://twitter.com/OurWorldInData/), [myself](https://twitter.com/redouad)) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edouardmathieu/), where we will always advertise new positions.

## Other opportunities outside OWID

If you're looking to work at an organization similar to OWID, I recommend following the [80,000 Hours job board](https://80000hours.org/job-board/). 80,000 Hours is a nonprofit that provides [free advice](https://80000hours.org/make-a-difference-with-your-career/) and support to have a greater impact with your career. Opportunities listed on the job board are always interesting, and many of them are related to data and research.

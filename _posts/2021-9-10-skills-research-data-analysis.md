_Last updated in April 2024._

I often receive emails asking for advice on the best ways to join [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/about) (OWID) as a data scientist, or how to build a stronger profile before applying. This article answers the most frequent questions people ask.

## Is OWID hiring right now? How can I know when a new position opens?

Even though our team has grown a lot, we still rarely open new positions — typically a handful of times per year. You will always find them on [our _Jobs_ page](https://ourworldindata.org/jobs) and we will advertise them in our newsletter. You can also follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edouardmathieu/), where we will usually advertise new positions multiple times.

## How much programming should I know?

Data wrangling in Python/pandas is the fundamental work that OWID's data scientists have to do. Therefore, it's an essential skill to master if you're considering joining us. You don't need other programming languages beyond Python. In fact, "Python and nothing else" is a much better profile for us than "everything but Python". But your application will stand out if you're already comfortable using a terminal and basic bash commands, have some experience with version control systems — especially GitHub — and have a working knowledge of SQL.

## Can I apply if I know R/Stata/SPSS/Julia, but not Python?

We used to hire data scientists who could only use R, but our data pipeline now relies exclusively on Python, so we only hire data scientists who can use Python very comfortably.

## How much statistics should I know?

Very little. We obviously want to hire data scientists who have excellent data literacy, and you should have a good understanding of statistical techniques essential to academic research (for example, confidence intervals), but we don't really use more advanced statistics than this.

## How much machine learning / AI / cloud computing should I know?

Many of our data scientists have some ML/AI/cloud experience, but it's not intrinsincally helpful to any of the work we do. We work with datasets that are small by industry standards, and our tech stack is not at the cutting edge of data science and cloud services. Instead, we want to provide the world with the cleanest, most-reliable, and best-documented datasets on crucial problems.

## How much research experience do I need?

You don't need extended experience in academia, but over time, I've found that having a very solid understanding of academic research correlates very highly with being a successful data scientist at OWID. This could mean having done some research yourself (for example, a Ph.D.) but more simply, you could have acquired this knowledge by being part of a research project, or read a lot of academic papers.

Another very helpful thing is having worked with some of our key sources of data, such as the World Bank's [World Development Indicators](https://datatopics.worldbank.org/world-development-indicators/) or [Poverty and Inequality Platform](https://pip.worldbank.org), the UN's [Sustainable Development Goals dataset](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs) or [World Population Prospects](https://population.un.org/wpp/), the WHO's [Global Health Observatory](https://www.who.int/data/gho) or [Global Health Estimates](https://www.who.int/data/global-health-estimates), the [Global Carbon Budget](https://globalcarbonbudget.org/), the [Statistical Review of World Energy](https://www.energyinst.org/statistical-review/), etc.

## Do I need a Ph.D.?

You don't need a Ph.D. ~50% of our data scientists don't have one, including myself. The reason why we often end up hiring people with PhDs isn't that it's a requirement; it's because having a Ph.D. is strongly correlated with other characteristics we look for: a very good understanding of research methods, experience with academic datasets, good skills in science communication, an ability to work autonomously, etc.

## What other skills do you look for?

Beyond [the skills that are useful to perform well in any job](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/how-to-be-successful/), here are some that are particularly important to OWID's work:

- fluency in English;
- good data judgement (attention to detail, thoughtful tradeoffs between data quantity and quality, careful and systematic thinking in situations where there is no perfect solution);
- very good knowledge of data visualization principles and good practices;
- intellectual curiosity, openness to new ideas and topics;
- flexibility to receive feedback, learn from new evidence, and change one's mind;
- ability and drive to work without supervision;
- proactivity, assertiveness;
- a good understanding of Our World in Data's [work](https://ourworldindata.org) and alignment with our [mission](https://ourworldindata.org/problems-and-progress).

## Which books would you recommend I read?

- [Hannah Ritchie, _Not the End of the World_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/145624737-not-the-end-of-the-world)
- [Hans Rosling, _Factfulness_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34890015-factfulness?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_11)
- [Nate Silver, _The Signal and the Noise_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13588394-the-signal-and-the-noise?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_11)
- [Julia Galef, _The Scout Mindset_](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/42041926)

## If OWID doesn't have any open positions, where else can I find similar positions?

If you want to work at an organization similar to OWID, I recommend following the [80,000 Hours job board](https://jobs.80000hours.org/?query=data). 80,000 Hours is a nonprofit that provides [free advice](https://80000hours.org/make-a-difference-with-your-career/) and support to have a greater impact on your career. Many of the opportunities listed on the job board are very interesting, and many are related to data and research.

## How can I get some practice?

While you're honing your skills or looking for a job, I'd strongly recommend checking whether your city has an existing "Data for Good" or "Tech for Good" community. These groups are typically composed of many members who volunteer to use their skills to work on interesting projects for a few weeks or months alongside their day job. While the range of projects may include more or less important and interesting problems, it's generally a good way to meet like-minded people, get more experience, and enrich your CV.

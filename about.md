## What I do

I'm the Head of Data & Research at [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org) (OWID), an online publication based out of the University of Oxford that focuses on large problems such as global health, poverty, climate change, education, human rights, economic development, and technological progress.

I manage a [team](https://ourworldindata.org/team) of data scientists and researchers who make these big problems â€“ and their possible solutionsÂ â€“ more accessible and understandable through articles and data visualizations. All our work is free and open access. Find out more [about OWID](https://ourworldindata.org/about) and [our mission](https://ourworldindata.org/problems-and-progress).

From 2020 to 2022, I led our work on the COVID-19 pandemic â€“ most notably our [Data Explorer](https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/coronavirus-data-explorer), our [global data on vaccinations](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations) used by most media organizations and international institutions, and our [open source dataset](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data) with 60+ metrics on the country-by-country evolution of the pandemic.

Before joining OWID in 2020, I previously worked as a data scientist at the University of Oxford in the departments of Population Health and Primary Care Health Sciences; and as a data science consultant in the private sector.

For an overview of my background, the work of our team at OWID, and the principles we follow to make research and data more understandable and accessible, you can listen to the following:

## Donation pledge

In 2018, I took the donation pledge of [Giving What We Can](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/pledge/), committing to give 10% of my income for the rest of my life to organizations that can most effectively use it to improve the lives of others. Currently, my donations are evenly split between [GiveDirectly's cash transfers to families in extreme poverty](https://www.givedirectly.org/large-transfer/) and [
GiveWell's Top Charities](https://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities).

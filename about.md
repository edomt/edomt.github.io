## What I do

### *Our World in Data*

I manage a team of data scientists at [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org) (OWID), a scientific online publication based out of the University of Oxford that focuses on large problems such as global health, poverty, climate change, human rights, war, existential risks, and innovation. Our goal is to make the research and data on these big problems accessible and understandable. Find out more [about OWID](https://ourworldindata.org/about) and [our mission](https://ourworldindata.org/problems-and-progress).

Since 2020, I've also led our work on the COVID-19 pandemic – most notably our [Data Explorer](https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/coronavirus-data-explorer), our [global data on vaccinations](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations) used by most media organizations and international institutions, and our [open source dataset](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data) with 60+ metrics on the country-by-country evolution of the pandemic.

I previously worked as a data scientist at the University of Oxford, in the departments of Population Health, and Primary Care Health Sciences; and as a data science consultant in the private sector.

For an overview of my background, the work of our team at OWID, and the principles we follow to make research and data more understandable and accessible, you can listen to:

- [My interview with Ivan Stegic on the TEN7 podcast](https://ten7.com/podcast/episode/edouard-mathieu-open-data-approach-solving-worlds-problems) (45 minutes, February 2021)
- [My interview with Fin Moorhouse & Luca Righetti on Hear This Idea](https://hearthisidea.com/episodes/mathieu) (3.5 hours, October 2022)

As part of the [Giving What We Can Pledge](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/pledge/) that I signed in 2018, I donate 10% of my income to high-impact, cost-effective charities based on [GiveWell's top charities](https://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities) and [HLI's advice for donors](https://www.happierlivesinstitute.org/give-now/). These include medicine and nets to prevent malaria, supplements to prevent vitamin A deficiency, cash incentives for routine childhood vaccines, and treatment for women struggling with depression in Uganda and Zambia.
